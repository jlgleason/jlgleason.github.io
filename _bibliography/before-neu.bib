  abstract = {We apply an ensemble pipeline composed of a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) as a general tool for addressing a range of disinformation problems. We also demonstrate the ability to use this architecture to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one domain to related (supervised and unsupervised) tasks. Character-level neural networks and transfer learning are particularly valuable tools in the disinformation space because of the messy nature of social media, lack of labeled data, and the multi-channel tactics of influence campaigns. We demonstrate their effectiveness in several tasks relevant for detecting disinformation: spam emails, review bombing, political sentiment, and conversation clustering.}

  abstract  = {Collections of time series with hierarchical and/or grouped structure are pervasive in real-world forecasting applications. Furthermore, one is often required to forecast across multiple levels of the hierarchy simultaneously, and to have all forecasts reconcile. This paper proposes a new approach to reconciliation, whereby a regularization term penalizes deviation from the known structure of the collection in a learned embedding space. Experiments on real-world Australian travel data demonstrate that the proposed regularization outperforms state-of-the-art MinT reconciliation [24] in three different forecasting settings. These settings include two challenging forecasting settings: short training sequences and a long forecast horizon. We also show that our proposed regularization term is robust to the relative size of the learned embedding space.}

  abstract  = {One of the challenges when building Machine Learning (ML) models using satellite imagery is building sufficiently labeled data sets for training. In the past, this problem has been addressed by adapting computer vision approaches to GIS data with significant recent contributions to the field. But when trying to adapt these models to Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery these approaches fall short. Previously, researchers used transfer learning methods trained on ImageNet and constrained the 13 channels to 3 RGB ones using existing training sets, but this severely limits the available data that can be used for complex image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks. To address this deficit, we present Distil, and demonstrate a specific method using our system for training models with all available Sentinel-2 channels. There currently is no publicly available rich labeled training data resource such as ImageNet for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery that covers the entire globe. Our approach using the Distil system was: a) pre-training models using unlabeled data sets and b) adapting to specific downstream tasks using a small number of annotations solicited from a user. We discuss the Distil system, an application of the system in the remote sensing domain, and a case study identifying likely locust breeding grounds in Africa from unlabeled 13-channel satellite imagery.},
