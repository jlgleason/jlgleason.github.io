  abstract  = {The contemporary Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) supplements classic blue hyperlinks with complex components. These components produce tensions between searchers, 3rd-party websites, and Google itself over clicks and attention. In this study, we examine 12 SERP components from two categories: (1) extracted results (e.g. <code>featured-snippets</code>) and (2) Google Services (e.g. <code>shopping-ads</code>) to determine their effect on peoples’ behavior. We measure behavior with two variables: (1) clickthrough rate (CTR) to Google’s own domains versus 3rd-party domains and (2) time spent on the SERP. We apply causal inference methods to an ecologically valid trace dataset comprising 477,485 SERPs from 1,756 participants. We find that multiple components substantially increase CTR to Google domains, while others decrease CTR and increase time on the SERP. These findings may inform efforts to regulate the design of powerful intermediary platforms like Google.},

  abstract  = {Keyword advertising on general web search engines is a multi-billion dollar business. Keyword advertising turns contentious, however, when businesses target ads against their competitors' brand names---a practice known as ``competitive poaching.'' To stave off poaching, companies defensively bid on ads for their own brand names. Google, in particular, has faced lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny since it altered its policies in 2004 to allow poaching. <p>In this study, we investigate the sources of advertising revenue earned by Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo by examining ad impressions, clicks, and revenue on <i>navigational</i> and <i>brand</i> searches. Using logs of searches performed by a representative panel of US residents, we estimate that ads on these searches account for 28--36\% of Google's search revenue, while Bing earns even more. We also find that the effectiveness of these ads for advertisers varies. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for advertisers and regulators.</p>},

  abstract  = {Is Google Search a monopoly with gatekeeping power? Regulators from the US, UK, and Europe have argued that it is based on the assumption that Google Search dominates the market for horizontal (a.k.a.``general") web search. Google disputes this, claiming that competition extends to all vertical (a.k.a. ``specialized") search engines, and that under this market definition it does not have monopoly power. <p>In this study we present the first analysis of Google Search’s market share under vertical segmentation of online search. We leverage observational trace data collected from a panel of US residents that includes their web browsing history and copies of the Google Search Engine Result Pages they were shown. We observe that participants’ search sessions begin at Google greater than 50% of the time in 24 out of 30 vertical market segments (which comprise almost all of our participants’ searches). Our results inform the consequential and ongoing debates about the market power of Google Search and the conceptualization of online markets in general.</p>},

  abstract  = {The results returned by image search engines have the power to shape peoples' perceptions about social groups. Existing work on image search engines leverages hand-selected queries for occupations like ``doctor'' and ``engineer'' to quantify racial and gender bias in search results. We complement this work by analyzing peoples' real-world image search queries and measuring the distributions of perceived gender, skin tone, and age in their results. We collect 54,070 unique image search queries and analyze 1,481 open-ended people queries (i.e., not queries for named entities) from a representative sample of 643 US residents. For each query, we analyze the top 15 results returned on both Google and Bing Images. <p>Analysis of real-world image search queries produces multiple insights. First, less than 5\% of unique queries are open-ended people queries. Second, fashion queries are, by far, the most common category of open-ended people queries, accounting for over 30\% of the total. Third, the modal skin tone on the Monk Skin Tone scale is two out of ten (the second lightest) for images from both search engines. Finally, we observe a bias against older people: eleven of our top fifteen query categories have a median age that is lower than the median age in the US.</p>},

Participants install a browser extension and/or mobile apps to donate their online activity data along with comprehensive survey responses. The infrastructure will offer approved researchers access to a suite of structured, parsed content data for selected domains to enable analyses and understanding of Internet use in the US. This is all conducted within a robust research ethics framework, emphasizing ongoing informed consent and multiple layers, technical and legal, of interventions to protect the values at stake in data collection, data access, and research. This paper provides a brief overview of the NIO infrastructure, the data collected, the participants, and the researcher intake process.},

  abstract    = {It is common for digital platforms to issue consequences for behaviors that violate Community Standards policies. However, there is limited evidence about the relative effectiveness of consequences, particularly lengths of temporary suspensions. This paper analyzes two massive field experiments (N<sub>1</sub> = 511,304; N<sub>2</sub> = 262,745) on Roblox that measure the impact of suspension duration on safety- and engagement-related outcomes. The experiments show that longer suspensions are more effective than shorter ones at reducing reoffense rate, the number of consequences, and the number of user reports. Further, they suggest that the effect of longer suspensions on reoffense rate wanes over time, but persists for at least 3 weeks. Finally, they demonstrate that longer suspensions are more effective for first-time violating users. These results have significant implications for theory around digitally-enforced punishments, understanding recidivism online, and the practical implementation of product changes and policy development around consequences.},
