Hi! I am a Computer Science PhD student at Northeastern's Khoury College, where I am advised by [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh/).  

I am interested in *auditing algorithms* - designing controlled experiments to evaluate sociotechnical systems and their impact on people and societies. I am especially interested in the economic and political power of large digital platforms, like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.

Before coming to Northeastern, I worked on identifying and characterizing disinformation campaigns at [New Knowledge](https://www.yonder-ai.com/) and on time series forecasting and remote sensing research at [Kungfu.ai](https://www.kungfu.ai/). I also volunteered with [Measure](https://wemeasure.org/)'s research and advocacy teams.
