Hi! I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science PhD candidate at Northeastern's Khoury College, where I'm advised by [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh/).  

I am interested in *auditing algorithms* - designing controlled experiments and observational studies to evaluate sociotechnical systems and their impact on people and societies. I am especially interested in the economic and political power of large digital platforms, like Google and Amazon.

Before Northeastern, I worked on identifying and characterizing disinformation campaigns at [New Knowledge/Yonder](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/primer-acquires-yonder-adds-disinformation-analysis-to-ai-portfolio-for-information-operations-301562840.html) and on time series forecasting and remote sensing research at [Kungfu.ai](https://www.kungfu.ai/).
