Hi! I'm a 4th-year Computer Science PhD candidate at Northeastern's Khoury College, where I'm advised by [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh/).  

I am a computational social scientist interested in questions about the governance of online platforms. My work focuses on 1) the economic power of online platforms and 2) trust and safety on online platforms. Methodologically, I'm interested in the design of experiments and observational causal inference. I was a PhD Data Science Intern on Roblox's Trust and Safety team in summer 2024.

<!-- 
I am interested in *auditing algorithms* - designing controlled experiments and observational studies to evaluate sociotechnical systems and their impact on people and societies. I am especially interested in the economic and political power of large digital platforms, like Google and Amazon. -->

Before Northeastern, I worked on identifying and characterizing disinformation campaigns at [New Knowledge/Yonder](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/primer-acquires-yonder-adds-disinformation-analysis-to-ai-portfolio-for-information-operations-301562840.html) and on time series forecasting and remote sensing research at [Kungfu.ai](https://www.kungfu.ai/).
