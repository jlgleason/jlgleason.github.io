Research with my Roblox colleagues was accepted at [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/): [In Suspense About Suspensions? The Relative Effectiveness of Suspension Durations on a Popular Social Platform](/assets/pdf/suspense-about-suspensions.pdf). I'll be returning to Roblox for another data science internship this summer.
